# Symfony.si

## About

Welcome to the Symfony Slovenia project. You probably wonder why is this project located in a separate repository and why a special seperate dedicated page for a PHP framework and community?
Symfony is a framework, community, a philosophy and more all working together in harmony and we believe that it deserves special attention for that matter so we've decided to make a website specially for a Slovenian Symfony community as well.
