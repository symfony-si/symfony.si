# Symfony.si

## About

Welcome to the Symfony Slovenia project. You probably wonder why is this project located in a separate
repository and why a special seperate dedicated page for a PHP framework and community?
Symfony is a framework, community, a philosophy and more all working together in harmony and we believe
that it deserves special attention for that matter so we've decided to make a website specially for a
Slovenian Symfony community as well.

Inpsired by Symfony Italia, Symfony Armenia and Symfony Spain here is Symfony Slovenia as well. Project
is open sourced and contributors to the project are most welcome.
